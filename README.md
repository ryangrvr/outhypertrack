Placeline is a ReactJS/NextJS sample application to track the movement of your mobile workforce through the workday. Use this web app to track the live location, activity, and outages of your business assets; track summaries for miles driven, steps walked, stops taken and inactive times; drill down to device locations organized in activity segments for each day, and export selected segments to 3rd party applications such as expense management software.

> ðŸ’¬ [Check out this blog post](https://hypertrack.com/blog/2019/09/09/open-sourcing-placeline-a-sample-app-to-track-the-movement-history-of-your-workforce/) to learn why this is important, how HyperTrack is using it internally, and how it all ties together with HyperTrack platform.

Placeline is built with HyperTrack Views.

## Requirements

The goal of this project is to get you to a deployed integration in minutes. For this to work, you need to have:

- [ ] Set up a [HyperTrack account](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/signup) and obtain your `AccountId` and `SecretKey` from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/)
- [ ] Integrate the HyperTrack SDK in your mobile application ([iOS](https://github.com/hypertrack/quickstart-ios), [Android](https://github.com/hypertrack/quickstart-android), or [React Native](https://github.com/hypertrack/quickstart-react-native)) or use our sample app to send location data ([iOS](https://github.com/hypertrack/live-app-ios) or [Android](https://github.com/hypertrack/live-app-android))

## Installation and setup

You can install this project on your local machine and deploy it quickly to Heroku for free.

### Local setup

After cloning or forking this repository, you should install all dependencies on your machine:

```shell
# with npm
npm install

# or with Yarn
yarn
```

Next, you need to set your environmental variables. The project uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), so it's best to create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project. This file is listed in `.gitignore` and shall not be checked into public repositories. Below is the content on the file - please ensure to replace the keys with your own:

```shell
# HyperTrack
HT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = <HT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>
```

With the dependencies and configuration in place, you can start the server in development mode:

```shell
# with npm
npm run dev

# or with Yarn
yarn dev
```

**Congratulations!** You just completed a web app for your HyperTrack integration.

### Heroku setup

This project is set up to be deployed to Heroku within seconds. You need a Heroku account. All you need to do is to click on the one-click-deploy button below. It will provide the following services and add-ons:

- Web Dyno - to run the server on Heroku (free)
- NodeJS buildpack - to run NextJS on Heroku (free)
- PaperTrail - hosted logging system (free)

Similar to the local setup, you need to have your keys ready before the deployment. The Heroku page will ask you for the following:

- `HT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your HyperTrack publishable key

You need to enter all of these keys for the project to run successfully. Heroku uses the input to pre-set the environmental variables for the deployment. You can change after the setup as well.

**Deploy this project now on Heroku:**

## Usage

Once the main page (_index.js_) is opened, it will load an embeddable view from HyperTrack to display all tracked devices. The HyperTrack View enables interaction, so drilling down onto a single device and its history is easily possible.
